# Bahn zum See

Just a quick learning prototype for kirby using [plain kit](https://github.com/mandrasch/ddev-kirby-plainkit) and [Kirby 3: How to build a website from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwjX8JAwBws&t=61s). Inspired by [bahn-zum-berg.at](https://www.bahn-zum-berg.at/).

```
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev exec npm install
ddev exec npm run dev
```

Open: https://bahn-zum-see.ddev.site:3000/ (via https!)

## What was done?

-   `ddev composer require diverently/laravel-mix-kirby` (https://github.com/Diverently/laravel-mix-kirby)
-   `npm init -y`
-   laravel mix (node): `ddev exec npm install laravel-mix --save-dev`
-   `ddev exec npm install bootstrap @popperjs/core --save-dev`
-   add scripts to package.json, change 'development' to 'dev' => https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/upgrade#after (alternative: https://github.com/Diverently/laravel-mix-kirby#npm-scripts)
-   formatting: `ddev exec npm install --save-dev prettier @prettier/plugin-php` (https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php)

-   Run via `ddev exec npm run dev`
